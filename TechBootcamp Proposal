<p>Content Development Plan</p>
<p>The proposed bootcamp program consists of 7 domains, each offering a range of courses. There will be a minimum of 25 courses and a maximum of 31 courses across all domains. These courses will be conducted over a period of 25 weeks, with two 90-minute sessions per week. The details of the course creation process are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The selection and division of topics for the courses have been carefully curated by the Core Engineering Group. The courses are approved by the Engineering team at 10Pearls.</li>
<li>Out of a total of 7 domains finalized, 6 domains are to have 4-6 courses each. This makes a total of 25 courses minimum and 35 courses at max.</li>
<li>Each domain will be categorized into different levels. Specifically, there will be 2 introductory level courses, 2 intermediate level courses, and 1 applied/advanced level course for each domain. The level distribution ensures that participants receive a comprehensive learning experience that progresses from foundational knowledge to more advanced and practical applications within each domain.</li>
<li>Each domain has been thoroughly analyzed and divided into relevant subtopics, and separate courses will be offered for each subtopic. This approach allows instructors to focus on specific aspects of each domain, ensuring a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</li>
