<p><strong>Welcome to “Salesforce – Asynchronous Apex”</strong></p>
<p>Mastering the basics is crucial for solving complex problems. This course serves as an introduction to the fundamental concept of ‘Asynchronous Apex’, vital for those aiming for a Salesforce developer role.</p>
<p><strong>What is the meaning of the word Asynchronous:</strong></p>
<p>Not occurring or existing at the same time or having the same period or phase.</p>
<p>Due to limitations imposed by Salesforce, real-time processing is not feasible for certain use cases. Such instances should be addressed using ‘Asynchronous Apex’, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot do callout after a DML operation.</li>
<li>DML operations on setup objects are not allowed after updating a non-setup object.</li>
<li>For jobs involving large data volumes, such as database maintenance, invoice generation, or payroll processing.</li>
<li>Job chaining.</li>
<li>To schedule a job for execution at a specific interval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Salesforce?</strong></p>
<p>Salesforce is renowned as the leading cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) platform globally. It aids in overseeing a company’s sales, marketing, customer support, and other business aspects. Salesforce achieved its prominence due to its cloud-based CRM software, hosted on Salesforce servers, allowing access for customers and developers via an internet connection and login credentials.</p>
