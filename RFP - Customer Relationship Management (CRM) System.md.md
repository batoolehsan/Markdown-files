<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>The CRM System will provide functionalities for managing customer profiles, tracking interactions, and analyzing customer data. Key features include customer segmentation, lead management, and campaign tracking. The system will be developed using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.</p>
<h2 id="technical-architecture">Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>The system will consist of the following microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication Service</strong>: Handles user authentication and authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Manages customer profiles and interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Service</strong>: Tracks marketing campaigns and their effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Service</strong>: Provides insights and analytics based on customer data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="database-design">Database Design</h2>
<p>We will use a relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing customer data and related information. The database schema will include tables for customers, interactions, campaigns, and user roles. We will use SQL queries and transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency.</p>
<h2 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h2>
<p>Each microservice will expose RESTful APIs for communication between components. The API endpoints will be documented using OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications. The documentation will include details such as request/response formats, authentication requirements, and error handling.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>The user interface will be developed using modern web technologies such as React.js for the frontend and Material-UI for the design components. The UI will be intuitive, responsive, and accessible across different devices and browsers.</p>
<h2 id="testing-plan">Testing Plan</h2>
<p>We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach, writing unit tests and integration tests for each microservice. Additionally, we will perform end-to-end testing using tools like Selenium for UI testing. Continuous integration (CI) pipelines will automate the testing process and ensure code quality.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-strategy">Deployment Strategy</h2>
<p>Deployment will be automated using Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration. We will use CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy changes to production environments. Monitoring and logging tools will be implemented to track system performance and troubleshoot issues.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The CRM System project represents a significant initiative for 10Pearls organization to enhance customer relationship management capabilities. By following these technical specifications and guidelines, we aim to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution that meets the needs of our clients.</p>
